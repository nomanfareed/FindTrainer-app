1. Based on this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biOMz4puGt8&feature=youtu.be
I want you to add this responsive and animated responsive siderbar in this component in angular 
=> FindTrainer-app\client2\src\app\pages\dashboard\dashboard-sidebar
We have css and html and ts, so make sure to add this features. Inside the Dashboard-sidebar.ts
we have a variable which is called => data: SidebBarContent[];
You need to use this as a content of the sidebar, it has a name, icon, and route for where is it going to navigate to


2. Based on this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLgtucwjVII

I want you to add this responsive top navbar in the => 
FindTrainer-app\client2\src\app\components\nav\navbar

Make sure that it has all the animation and content that is in the video
I don't care where they are navigate to, i care more about the design and responsive


3.  Add https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-mat-select-search and replace the current mulitselect from FindTrainer-app\client2\src\app\_form\multi-select, make sure that you 
are not changing the methods but just a different select input
