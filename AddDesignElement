I want you to add this responsive and animated responsive siderbar in this component in angular 
=> FindTrainer-app\client2\src\app\pages\dashboard\dashboard-sidebar
We have css and html and ts, so make sure to add this features. Inside the Dashboard-sidebar.ts
we have a variable which is called => data: SidebBarContent[];
You need to use this as a content of the sidebar, it has a name, icon, and route for where is it going to navigate to
