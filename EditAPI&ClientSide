1. Make sure if User has a property isTrainer == true then this user can only create   max 5 ApplicationUserFocuses.

2. Make sure if User has a property isTrainer == true then this user can't write a review and can't write a message

3. Make sure if User has a property isTrainer == false then this user can't write a review to the same person more than once.

4. Make sure if User has a property isTrainer == false, then this user can only write review and message to users who has a property isTrainer == true ONLY.

  KnownAs: string = null;
  
  AND  User has a property isTrainer == false or true can all update their password, to update their password. PasswordUpdateDto should look like this=>
  currentPassword: string;

6. I already created the login and register page in the frontend, make sure that client can send request to backend to get authenticatied and authroized. There should also be 
a log out feature for user to logout in the AuthService and the client components.

7. Please read comments on FindTrainer-app\client2\src\app\_model\_DTOs\IReviewForUpdateDto.ts and create those routes and dtos in the backend to
return a list of data that is similar to those 2 interfaces that i created

9. I changed the IUserForListDto in the client2 folder, make sure that you change the api and backend dtos and return the data that
the client2 is looking for. Also I changed the UserParams, make sure to change backend UserParams dto to use it to filter.

10. Add Error handling in the angular http interceptor and combine that with the backend error handling.
