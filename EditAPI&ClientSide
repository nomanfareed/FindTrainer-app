6. I already created the login and register page in the frontend, make sure that client can send request to backend to get authenticatied and authroized. There should also be 
a log out feature for user to logout in the AuthService and the client components.

7. Please read comments on FindTrainer-app\client2\src\app\_model\_DTOs\IReviewForUpdateDto.ts and create those routes and dtos in the backend to
return a list of data that is similar to those 2 interfaces that i created, make sure to add authorization, and make sure that the client can send request
in the FindTrainer-app\client2\src\app\_services\_reviewsS Folder to the backend for requesting those information


8. Add https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-mat-select-search and replace the current mulitselect from FindTrainer-app\client2\src\app\_form\multi-select, make sure that you 
are not changing the methods but just a different select input

9. I changed the IUserForListDto in the client2 folder, make sure that you change the api and backend dtos and return the data that
the client2 is looking for. Also I changed the UserParams, make sure to change backend UserParams dto to use it to filter.

10. Add Error handling in the angular http interceptor and combine that with the backend error handling.
